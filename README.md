PROJECT NAME :-

E-Commerce Product Management Utility with Hibernate
-----------------------------------------------------
The E-Commerce Product Management Utility is a Java web application that facilitates efficient product management for an online store. It includes user authentication for admin access and utilizes Hibernate technology for seamless database connectivity. The application enables authenticated admins to add, edit, and delete products, with the total size of uploaded products displayed on the same page.

Key Features:

1.User Authentication: Admin users are required to provide their username and password for authentication. The application verifies the submitted credentials against existing user information stored in the database. Upon successful authentication, the admin gains access to the product management interface.

2.Product Management Interface: The admin is presented with a user-friendly interface displaying the list of added products. For each product, attributes like title, quantity, size, and image are displayed, allowing the admin to easily review and modify product details.

3.Edit and Delete Products: The admin can edit the attributes of any added product, such as updating the title, quantity, size, or image. Additionally, the admin has the option to delete products from the inventory as needed.

4.Total Size Calculation: The application calculates the total size of all uploaded products and displays it at the bottom of the product listing. This feature allows the admin to track the overall size of the product catalog.

5.Data Model: The application employs a well-designed data model to represent product information, admin user credentials, and other relevant data. The data model is implemented using Hibernate POJOs, ensuring a seamless interaction with the database.

6.Object Model: An object model is established to represent the relationships between entities, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management within the application.

7.Validation and Info Messages: The application includes proper validation to ensure that only valid data is entered. Informative messages are displayed on the console wherever required, guiding the admin through the product management process.

8.Exception Handling: Comprehensive exception handling is implemented to handle unexpected scenarios gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the admin when necessary.

9.Hibernate Technology: Hibernate is used to facilitate database connectivity, handling the mapping between Java objects and the relational database. SQL scripts are avoided, and HQL (Hibernate Query Language) is utilized for database operations.

10.Web Server: The application is designed to be deployed on Tomcat version 8 or above, ensuring a stable and efficient web server environment.

Overall, the E-Commerce Product Management Utility with Hibernate offers a secure and user-friendly solution for admin users to efficiently manage the online store's product catalog. Its seamless integration with Hibernate ensures robust data storage and retrieval, while the intuitive interface and error handling enhance the overall user experience.
